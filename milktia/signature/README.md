# Overview

In this step, operators are required to sign signatures to setup the preparation for launch step in [this technical architecture](https://github.com/milkyway-labs/architecture).

## Multisig Accounts

The following multisig accounts are generated from Step 1 process.

| Name | Address |
|---|---|
| `Staker`            |`celestia1vxzram63f7mvseufc83fs0gnt5383lvrle3qpt` |
| `Staker Controller` |`celestia16g5l6n9kg6879z695g6qjh70qv6wzqg640z9pn` |
| `Rewards Collector` |`celestia1vr00egrck8a0dax68fgglrm3n8v4yz9wjj7cj2` |
| `Grantee`           |`celestia1fl85qh9pw4ju48zy2eqr8h0h6d8hwgpq5880wd` |

Run the following script to add the generated multisig accounts:

```bash
sh generate_multisigs.sh
```

## Signing signatures

For your convenience, the following JSON files are prepared.

- `unsigned_tx_signature1.json`
- `unsigned_tx_signature2.json`
- `unsigned_tx_signature3.json`

### Signature 1

This transaction grants a full authorization, fee allowance, and change the withdrawal address of the Staker multisig to the Staker Controller multisig.

The `unsigned_tx_signature1.json` file includes the following grants:

- [MsgGrant](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.46.14/proto/cosmos/authz/v1beta1/tx.proto#L20)
    - This grant grants a full authorization to the `Staker Controller` multisig.
- [MsgGrantAllowance](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.46.14/proto/cosmos/feegrant/v1beta1/tx.proto#L16)
    - This grant is needed for the `Staker Controller` to grant fee allowance to the `Grantee` account so that it can use transaction fees from the `Staker` multisig account.
- [SetWithdrawAddress](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.46.14/proto/cosmos/distribution/v1beta1/tx.proto#L16)
    - This grant is needed for the `Staker Controller` to grant change of the staking rewards withdrawal address from the `Staker` multisig to the `Grantee` account.

Now, connect your ledger to your device and sign it.

```bash
# Import your `Staker` wallet
# Change index to the one that you have used when setting the account
celestia-appd keys add op-staker --ledger --index 0

# We use the following public RPC endpoint to get account number.
# In case it is not responsive, use any alternatives in https://docs.celestia.org/nodes/mainnet
NODE="https://celestia-rpc.mesa.newmetric.xyz:443"
STAKER_ADDR="celestia1vxzram63f7mvseufc83fs0gnt5383lvrle3qpt"

# Sign the unsigned transaction
# Make sure you change the `NAME` and `OPERATOR_NAME`
celestia-appd tx sign unsigned_tx_signature1.json \
--chain-id celestia \
--from op-staker \
--multisig $STAKER_ADDR \
--ledger \
--node $NODE \
--sign-mode amino-json \
--output-document=signature1_{OPERATOR_NAME}.json
```

### Signature 2

This transaction grants a limited authorization to the `Grantee` account on behalf of the `Staker` using the `Staker Controller`.

The `unsigned_tx_signature2.json` file includes the following grants and messages:

- [MsgDelegate](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.46.14/proto/cosmos/staking/v1beta1/tx.proto#L26)
    - This grant is needed for the `Grantee` to delegate on behalf of the `Staker` multisig. It is important to note that the grant is setup with an allow list of validators selected by the MilkyWay protocol. With this constraint, the `Grantee` is only permitted to delegate among the validators listed in the allow list.
- [MsgUndelegate](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.46.14/proto/cosmos/staking/v1beta1/tx.proto#L34)
    - This grant is needed for the `Grantee` to undelegate on behalf of the `Staker` multisig. It is important to note that the grant is setup with an allow list of validators selected by the MilkyWay protocol. With this constraint, the `Grantee` is only permitted to undelegate among the validators listed in the allow list.
- [MsgBeginRedelegate](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.46.14/proto/cosmos/staking/v1beta1/tx.proto#L30)
    - This grant is needed for the `Grantee` to redelegate delegations from the `Staker` multisig account in case validator set is changed. It is important to note that the grant is setup with an allow list of validators selected by the MilkyWay protocol. With this constraint, the `Grantee` is only permitted to redelegate among the validators listed in the allow list.
- [MsgWithdrawDelegatorReward](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.46.14/proto/cosmos/distribution/v1beta1/tx.proto#L20)
    - This grant is needed to allow the `Grantee` to withdraw staking rewards from `the Staker` multisig account.
- [MsgTransfer](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v6.2.0/proto/ibc/applications/transfer/v1/tx.proto#L14)
    - This grant is needed for the `Grantee` to IBC transfer. It is important to note that the grant is setup with the specific source port, channel and an allow list of the MilkyWay’s staking contract address. With this constraint, the grantee is permitted to IBC transfer to the contract address.
- [MsgSetWithdrawAddress](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.46.14/proto/cosmos/distribution/v1beta1/tx.proto#L16)
    - This message is needed to change the withdraw address for rewards associated with the `Staker` multisig account to the `Rewards Collector` multisig account to enhance accounting management.
- [MsgGrantAllowance](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.46.14/proto/cosmos/feegrant/v1beta1/tx.proto#L16)
    - This message is needed for the `Grantee` to use transaction fees from the `Staker` multisig account.

Now, connect your ledger to your device and sign it.

```bash
# Import your `Staker Controller` wallet
# Change index to the one that you have used when setting the account
celestia-appd keys add op-staker-controller --ledger --index 1

# We use the following public RPC endpoint to get account number.
# In case it is not responsive, use any alternatives in the following link
# https://docs.celestia.org/nodes/mainnet
NODE="https://celestia-rpc.mesa.newmetric.xyz:443"
CONTROLLER_ADDR="celestia16g5l6n9kg6879z695g6qjh70qv6wzqg640z9pn"

# Sign the unsigned transaction
# Make sure you change the `NAME` and `OPERATOR_NAME`
celestia-appd tx sign unsigned_tx_signature2.json \
--chain-id celestia \
--from op-staker-controller \
--multisig $CONTROLLER_ADDR \
--ledger \
--node $NODE \
--output-document=signature2_{OPERATOR_NAME}.json
```

### Signature 3

This transaction grants IBC transfer with limited authorization from the `Rewards Collector` to the `Grantee` account.

The `unsigned_tx_signature3.json` file includes the following grants:

- [MsgTransfer](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/v6.2.0/proto/ibc/applications/transfer/v1/tx.proto#L14)
    - This grant is needed for the `Grantee` to IBC transfer staking rewards. It is important to note that the grant is setup with the specific source port, channel and an allow list of the MilkyWay’s staking contract address. With this constraint, the grantee is permitted to IBC transfer to the contract address.

Now, connect your ledger to your device and sign it.

```bash
# Import your Rewards Collector wallet
# Change index to the one that you have used when setting the account
celestia-appd keys add op-rewards-collector --ledger --index 2

# We use the following public RPC endpoint to get account number.
# In case it is not responsive, use any alternatives in the following link
# https://docs.celestia.org/nodes/mainnet
NODE="https://celestia-rpc.mesa.newmetric.xyz:443"
REWARDS_COLLECTOR_ADDR="celestia1vr00egrck8a0dax68fgglrm3n8v4yz9wjj7cj2"

# Sign the unsigned transaction
# Make sure you change the `NAME` and `OPERATOR_NAME`
celestia-appd tx sign unsigned_tx_signature3.json \
--chain-id celestia \
--from op-rewards-collector \
--multisig $REWARDS_COLLECTOR_ADDR \
--ledger \
--node $NODE \
--output-document=signature3_{OPERATOR_NAME}.json
```
